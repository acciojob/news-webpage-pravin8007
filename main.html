				<p>Beginner 2 - For the students who are in B2 their Module test will be on 5th August, its very important to attend the module test otherwise you have to repeat B2 again, 
                Students who will "fail" the Module test will also have to repeat B2 and the students who will "pass" the Module test will be shifted to their respective modules (your preference is recorded from the form you have filled yesterday).
